# JDA-template
This is a basic template for a Java Discord Bot using the JDA Wrapper(https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)

This is mostly for me, but if anyone somehow sees this, then feel free to fork/copy or use this royalty free :)
# Usage
Just paste the token you get from the Discord Developer console instead of the "EXAMPLE TOKEN: 1230e9dsujSHkoeri945tkf339345ghjk06978z" placeholder.

Also, this project uses maven with the shade plugin, so you may need to configure that.
